      <p>There have been constant debates about if and how depression
        affects the human brain. The common misconception is that
        depression only affects people mentally, but there are also physical
        effects that depression has on the most important organ of our bodies.

            <h3>Amygdala</h3>
            <p>Depression causes the amygdala to become overly
              active which sends messages to your body to produce sad stimuli that can appear
              in the form of sad faces. Stress hormones are also released by the amygdala
              when a person is experiencing depression.</p>

          <div class="inner">
            <h3>Hippocampus</h3>
            <p>This part of the brain shrinks in people who have constant
              struggles with depression or people who haven't treated their
              depression. The hippocampus is responsible for storing memories and
              emotion, so when this shrinks, a person's capability of remembering
              things decreases.</p>

            <h3>Dorsomedial Thalamus</h3>
            <p>Some studies show that the thamulus increases activation by
              producing a larger number of nerve cells when people are depressed.
              People with major depressive disorders also tend to have a larger
              thalamus than others. The thalamus is responsible for thinking, talking,
              seeing and moving.</p>
